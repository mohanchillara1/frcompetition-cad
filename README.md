FRC Competition Design

Overview

-Designed and iterated a competition drivetrain for a FIRST Robotics robot using Onshape/Fusion 360. The design prioritized structural rigidity, weight efficiency, and reliability under high-impact match conditions.

My Role

-Collaborated with the mechanical subteam, where I specifically designed the intake and the elevator subsystems. I also learned how to create a drivebase for future competitions.

Design Goals

-Withstand defensive impacts during matches(as we were a defensive robot)

-Have a rapid elevator system while still maintaining manageable center of gravity

-Optimize space for additional subsystems

-Speed and agility during transitions in matches

Engineering Constraints

-Competition weight limits

-Frame perimeter rules

-Need for rapid manufacturability

-High collision environment

Key Design Decisions

-Selected Kraken x44s for increased amounts of torque and faster gear ratios rather than the standard NEO

-Designed frame geometry to increase stiffness without excessive weight

-Planned positioning of the intake on the top of the robot to have increased efficiency when picking up game pieces and increased structural integrity

Future Improvements

-Future iterations could explore a climbing mechanism to score more points as well as stability in the middle areas near the intake and the elevator
